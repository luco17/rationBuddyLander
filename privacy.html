          <p>
            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
            consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data,

            data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,

            requirements.

            deleted and its associated data will be retained for a maximum of 6
            years from the account deletion date.
