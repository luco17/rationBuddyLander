        <h3>TERMS OF USE - APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS</h3>
        <h4>1. App Purpose and Limitations</h4>
        <p>
          1.1. The Service is provided to enable users to calculate and plan
          livestock feed rations and nutritional requirements. We do not
          conceive, design, monitor, or verify any feeding programs or
          nutritional calculations, and we do not accept any responsibility for
          you using or following them, or any adverse effects on livestock
          health or performance that may result. We do not provide, and no part
          of the Service should be construed as providing, professional
          veterinary or animal nutrition advice. You acknowledge and agree that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Livestock nutrition is complex and depends on numerous variables
          </li>
          <li>
            Incorrect feeding decisions can impact animal health and performance
          </li>
          <li>
            You are solely responsible for verifying any calculations or
            recommendations
          </li>
          <li>
            You will exercise professional judgment and seek expert advice when
            needed
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          1.2 You should consider consulting a qualified animal nutritionist or
          veterinarian before implementing any feeding program, particularly if
          your livestock have any health conditions, special nutritional
          requirements, or if you have any concerns about their dietary needs.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Disclaimers</h4>
        <p>
          2.1. Except as set out in this agreement, the Service is provided
          &quot;as is&quot; and without any guarantee, warranties or
          representations. To the fullest extent legally permissible, we
          disclaim any and all conditions and warranties, whether express or
          implied, including but not limited to those as to quality, fitness for
          purpose, non-infringement, title, quiet enjoyment, or freedom from
          viruses or malware.

          you for foreseeable loss or damage that you suffer as a result. By
          "foreseeable" we mean that, at the time this agreement was made,
          either it was clear that such loss or damage would occur or you and we
          both knew that it might reasonably occur, as a result of something we
          did (or failed to do).
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2. Except as set out in paragraph 4.1 and to the fullest extent
          legally permissible, we shall not be liable to you for any losses,
          whether in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise (including but
          not limited to direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential
          losses or damages), that are directly or indirectly related to:

            User-created feed rations, nutritional calculations, or other
            content;
          </li>
          <li>Your inability to use the Service;</li>
          <li>
            Use of your saved rations or calculations by third parties in
            accordance with this agreement;
          </li>
          <li>
            Any third party claim of intellectual property infringement relating
            to your content;
          </li>
          <li>
            Any damage to any devices, including any computer, mobile device, or
            other equipment or technology, including but not limited to any
            damage which results from any security breach or from any virus,
            bug, malware or fraud;
          </li>
          <li>Loss of, or damage to, any content or other data;</li>
          <li>
            Accuracy of nutritional information, calculations, or results.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          4.3. We are not liable to you for any loss or damage that was not
          foreseeable, any loss or damage not caused by our breach or
          negligence, any special, exemplary, punitive, indirect or
          consequential damages of any kind, or any business losses (including
          but not limited to loss of profit, loss of livestock productivity,
          business interruption, or loss of business opportunity, whether direct
          or indirect and whether or not foreseeable).
        </p>
        <p>
          4.4. Subject to the foregoing provisions, and to the extent
          permissible by law, our maximum aggregate liability to you under or in
          connection with this agreement (including your use of the Service)
          whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, shall
          in all circumstances be limited to Â£5,000.00. This does not apply to
          the types of liability set out in paragraph 4.5.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.5. Nothing in these terms excludes or limits our liability for any
          death or personal injury caused by our negligence, liability for fraud
          or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that the law
          does not allow us to exclude or limit.

          personal information we collect from you, how and why we collect,
          store, use and share such information, your rights in relation to it

          or complaint. By accessing and using the Service, you agree that you
          have read and understood the terms of our privacy policy and accept
          that we will process your personal information as described therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2. We may collect and use technical data that might include, for
          example, the specifications of your device and its software in order
          to help us provide software updates, product support, and other
          services related to the app. We may also use this information, as long
          as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve
          products or to offer new services or technologies to you.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Intellectual property rights and licence restrictions</h4>
        <p>6.1. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>

            granted limited permission to use search retrieval applications to

            operatorâs public online search service).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>7. Termination</h4>
        <p>
          7.1. We can end this agreement if you do not comply with any part of
          it or if our agreement with the app store ends for any reason
          whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.2. We will give you a reasonable amount of notice before the
          agreement ends but if what you have done is serious then we may end
          this agreement immediately and without advance notice to you.
          &quot;Serious&quot; means that you are causing harm (or attempting to
          cause harm) to other users, interfering with the operation of the app
          or doing anything else that we think presents a big enough risk to
          justify us ending the agreement quickly.
        </p>
        <p>7.3. The consequences of the agreement ending are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>

            associated Content in any form and we may remotely limit your

          <li>
            7.3.2. you must delete our app and any other software provided by us
            from any devices that it has been installed on; and
          </li>
          <li>
            7.3.3. we may delete or suspend access to any accounts that you hold
            with us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          7.4. You have the right to close your account and cease use of the
          Service via your profile within the Service. We do not retain or
          archive a copy of your data or Content in the event that you delete
          your account, though some Content may continue to be made accessible
          via the Service as described in this agreement.
        </p>
        <h4>8. Transferring this agreement</h4>
        <p>
          8.1. We may transfer our rights under this agreement to another
          business without your consent, but we will notify you of the transfer
          and make sure that you are not adversely affected as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2. You are not allowed to transfer your rights under this agreement
          to anyone without our prior written consent.
        </p>
        <h4>9. Entire agreement</h4>
        <p>
          This agreement, together with any documents referred to in them
          constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use
          of the app, superseding any prior agreements between you and us.
        </p>
        <h4>10. Events outside our control</h4>
        <p>
          We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or
          delay in performance of, any of our obligations under this agreement
          that is caused by any act or event beyond our reasonable control,
          including failure of public or private telecommunications networks.
        </p>
        <h4>11. Governing law and jurisdiction</h4>
        <p>
          The laws of England apply to this agreement, although if you are
          resident elsewhere you will retain the benefit of any mandatory
          protections given to you by the laws of the country in which you live.
          Any disputes will be subject to the jurisdiction of the English
          courts, except that if you are resident in Scotland, Wales, or
          Northern Ireland, you may bring a claim in your local court.
